# Arduino Mouth-Operated Mouse: Questions & To-Do List

## Questions to Consider

1. **User Experience**
   - How comfortable is the mouthpiece during extended use?
   - Is the sensitivity appropriate for precise cursor control?
   - Are the pressure thresholds for different actions (clicks, scrolling) intuitive?
   - How easy is it for new users to learn the controls?

2. **Hardware**
   - Is the current pressure sensor providing consistent readings?
   - Could a different joystick model provide better control?
   - How durable is the current setup during daily use?
   - Is the tubing material comfortable and hygienic for long-term use?
   - What ways can the tubing for air be cleaned?
   - Are there any alternatives or changes to make the current setup even cheaper?

3. **Software**
   - Is the response time fast enough for all applications?
   - Are there any compatibility issues with different operating systems?
   - How reliable is the serial connection between Arduino and computer?
   - Could the code be optimized for better performance?
   - Is it possible to upgrade to other Arduino modules?

4. **Accessibility**
   - Could the design be simplified further to make it easier to build?
   - Are the components readily available worldwide?
   - Is the total cost low enough to be accessible to most users?
   - Are the assembly instructions clear enough for people with limited technical experience?
